# Portainer CE
Portainer Community Edition (CE) is an open-source management UI that simplifies the deployment, configuration, and monitoring of containerized environments. It provides a graphical interface for managing Docker, Kubernetes, and other container technologies, reducing the need for direct command-line operations. Widely used by developers and system administrators, Portainer CE makes container management accessible and efficient.

## Key facts
- Developer: Portainer.io
- Initial release: 2017
- License: Business Source License (BSL) for CE
- Primary use: Docker and Kubernetes management UI
- Deployment: Docker container or standalone binary

## Architecture and Core Features
Portainer CE consists of a lightweight web UI and a backend service that communicates with container environments via the Docker API or Kubernetes API. It enables users to visualize containers, images, networks, and volumes; manage stacks using Docker Compose files; and monitor container performance in real time. Authentication, role-based access control, and remote environment management are also supported.

## Supported Environments
Although originally designed for Docker, Portainer CE now supports multiple container runtimes and orchestrators. These include standalone Docker hosts, Docker Swarm clusters, Kubernetes clusters, and edge computing devices. The platform’s agent-based architecture allows centralized management of distributed environments from a single dashboard.

## Use Cases and Importance
Portainer CE is widely adopted in small to medium organizations and development teams seeking to streamline container management. It helps new users understand container ecosystems visually while offering experienced operators a unified view of multiple environments. Its ease of deployment and open-source nature make it a common tool in DevOps workflows, test labs, and edge deployments.

## Relationship to Portainer Business Edition
Portainer CE serves as the free, community-supported foundation of Portainer’s ecosystem. The Business Edition (BE) builds upon CE with additional enterprise-focused capabilities, such as advanced RBAC, external authentication, and commercial support options.
